Feedback:
- Decouple controlling kservice traffic from analytics. Need 2 CRDs.
  Pro: more transparency, easier to debug, BYO analytics, contribute Traffic controller to Knative, different persona
  Cons: yet another CRDs


Open questions
- how to promote candidate to current?
  plan behavior: when rollout is completed.
- how to promote latest revisions to candidate?
  plan behavior: when no candidate
- When to reset analytic last state
  current behavior: each time the spec changes.

Knative serving behavior
- when only one revision traffic.current = traffic.latest, and cannot set rolloutPercent
- when has 2 revisions but revisions is not set, cannot set rolloutPercent
- status.traffic has current, candidate and latest
- revisions can have 1 or 2 values only (current and candidate)
